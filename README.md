Food Delivery Time Prediction – Machine Learning Project
Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict food delivery times and classify deliveries as Fast or Delayed.

The objective is to:

Predict exact delivery time using Linear Regression

Classify orders as Fast or Delayed using Logistic Regression
